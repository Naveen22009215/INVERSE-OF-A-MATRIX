# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:

### Step1 : 
we are importing numpy as np.
### Step 2: 
then we naming a matrix as A.
### Step 3: 
applying value for A.
### Step 4: 
then printing A using keyword of np.linalg.inv(A).


## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: P NAVEEN KUMAR
#RegisterNumber:22009215
import numpy as np
A=[[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]]
print(np.linalg.inv(A))
```
## Output:
![inverse](/op1.png)

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
